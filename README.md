####Requirements
The team has defined a set of requirements which may broadly be grouped into two

product) are necessary for a barebones alpha release of the software. Requirements are
listed in order of descending priority.

######NOT-MVP

courses, multiple sessions of a course, and multiple days in a session

and be able to view them later
